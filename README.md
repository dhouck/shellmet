This is a resource pack for Minecraft versions 1.15+ to change the name of turtle shellmets to use that portmanteau.

# Installation

Either clone this repository to the Minecraft resource pack folder, or download the .zip archive to that location.

To find this folder, open Minecraft and go to Options…, Resource Packs…, and then Open Resource Pack Folder.

To enable the resource pack, go to that same Minecrfat screen and move the shellmet pack from the Available Resource Packs column to the Selected Resource Packs column.
